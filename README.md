# Overview
Hello! My name is Cayson Howard. I am currently at college studying software engineering. I want to get better at programming and learn a few languages, so over the last two weeks, I spent on average an hour per day learning and programming in java in order to gain a basic understanding of how it works.

I read a few ideas online of different beginner projects that people usually work on when getting stated with Java. I wanted to learn a few new things, so I decided to do something a little bit different. I have a hard time keeping track of all of my passwords as well as come up with new ones. I decided that making a simple password creator/saver would help me to manage my passwords. It would also make a good beginner project to work on while learning a new language.

# Development Environment
To create a similar project you can use the following recources. Download the Java sdk to create Java projects as well as visual studio code to code the project in.

# Useful Websites
Here are some website that I used to help me learn java and make this program:

- [Beginner Java Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiJGTPuVeU&t=2811s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
- [String Builder](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/java-tutorial/stringbuilder-in-java#:~:text=StringBuilder%20in%20Java%20is%20a,an%20immutable%20succession%20of%20characters.)

# Future Work
There are a few things that I would like to add to this progam:

- Main Menu System: Allow the user to either generate a new Password or look at previosly created ones.
- Password Name: Currently the password is saved into a file as a single string. Adding the ability to "name" the password so you know were it was used.
- Encript Password File: Currently the password file is being saved into a text file. Adding a layer of security so the user needs to enter a password before being able to view them would help make it a bit more secure.
- Password Specs: Adding the ability for the user to specify how many of each charactar type they would like in the password would help the generator create passwords that fullfill the specifications of whatever the password is being generated for.
